# **Menstrual Cycle Data Analysis**

## **Overview**

This project analyzes the data on Menstrual health collected via survey, to explore different lifestyle factors, such as sleep, stress, diet, and other factors influence on a woman's menstrual health and their cycle regularity. The goal of the project was to uncover various patterns that can raise awaareness about menstrual health, and promote better self-care through data driven insights. 

## **Objectives**
1. Analyze relationships between stress levels, sleep duration, and cycle irregularities
2. Visualize trends and distributions using Seaborn and Matplotlib
3. Provide data-backed insights to improve awareness about lifestyle impacts on menstrual cycles

## **Tools and Technology Used**
1. Excel   -  Data organization and preprocessing
2. Python  -  Data Cleaning and manipulation
3. Seaborn -  Data Visualization

## **Key Insights Found**

### 1. Cycle Length & Duration Pattern

- Average Cycle Length: 26.75 days
- Spread (Range): 24.5 days
- Most Frequent Cycle Range: 24.5 days (clustered around 24–28)

Most participants maintain a regular cycle, aligning with the medically healthy range of 26–32 days.
However, the wide spread (24.5) hints that a few users experience irregular or fluctuating cycles, possibly influenced by stress, sleep, or hormonal imbalance.

### 2. Period Duration Patterns

- Average Period Duration: 3.7 days
- Spread: 3.5 days
- Most Common Duration: 21–28 day range

Most cycles from the collected data show normal bleeding patterns (3–5 days), reflecting healthy uterine rhythms. A few shorter durations could indicate lighter flows or shorter luteal phases.


### 3. Most Common Symptoms Reported

Back pain and cramps dominate the chart, marking them as the most universal experiences. Fatigue and headaches follow close behind, highlighting the physical toll during menstruation.

### 4. Emotional & Mental Health Patterns

- Emotional tags like severe mood swings, anxiety,” and sadness spike right before or during menstruation.
- Mild irritability or mood swings are the most frequent emotional states logged, suggesting low-to-moderate PMS presence.
- A minority report no noticeable changes, showing resilience or effective coping habits.

Emotional instability correlates with more physical symptoms, reinforcing the body–mind connection during hormonal shifts.

###5. Productivity and Menstrual Phases

Productivity levels dip noticeably during menstruation and recover post-cycle. Emotional well-being and symptom severity directly impact daily output.

## Future Enahncements

- Integrate Machine Learning models to predict cycle irregularities
- Build an interactive dashboard for real-time visualization
- Expand dataset to include more lifestyle parameters
